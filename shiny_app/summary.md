## More info / Notes

I limited the names to the top-20 most popular due to memory constraints; the file containing counts and ranks for all names from 1880 to 2013 was nearly 60MB, which was a bit too large for Shiny to handle gracefully.

You can find more background information on the Baby Names data set at [this link](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html), including some known caveats (e.g. data before 1934 is known to be incomplete, names such as 'Baby' and 'Unknown' are not filtered, etc).

You can find the code that I used to convert the original zip file into the dataset used by the app [at GitHub.](https://github.com/balladeer/coursera_data_products_shiny_app/blob/master/prep_data.R)

Finally, I have included a data table (below) that you can use to look through the data itself, if you so choose.

If you have any feedback or comment, feel free to let me know at zachary.t.cross@gmail.com.
