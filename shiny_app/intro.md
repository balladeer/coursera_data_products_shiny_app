When a baby is born in the United States, the [Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov/) records that baby's name and gender when processing social security card applications.  The administration has compiled that data into the [Baby Names](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data) database, which is the basis for this application.

The top 20 most-used names by gender were parsed from the database for every year from 1960 to 2013.  Below, you can choose which gender you would like to explore, and can then choose which names you would like to see the counts of by year.

This first plot shows the number of babies given each name. Most names will show a rise in popularity, followed by a decline that ends with the name leaving the top 20.  Some names, however, show up in the top 20 in many different sets of years (e.g. 'Anthony' for boys.)
