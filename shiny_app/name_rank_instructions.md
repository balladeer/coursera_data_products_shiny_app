### Controls for the by-rank chart

To the right, you will find the controls for the second graph: a gender selection option and a date-range selection.

You may switch between `male` and `female` names by selecting the desired gender from the radio button to the left.  This will determine which set of names to show rankings for.

The date-range selection will determine which years to plot the name rankings for.
