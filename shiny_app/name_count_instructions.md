### Controls for the by-count chart

To the right, you will find the controls for the first graph: a gender selection option and a name-selection box.

You may switch between `male` and `female` names by selecting the desired gender from the radio button to the left.

Once selected, the names available in the `Names to View` will change to the appropriate set of names.  You may select as many names as you would like, though the graph will become harder to read as more and more names are added.
